    The vSphere IPI configure step chain generates prerequisites for installing
    a cluster: virtual IP addresses, DNS records, and the install-config.yaml.
    Resources are created based on the cluster profile and optional input files.
    
    This chain includes the single-node-conf-vsphere step to configure a single node cluster supported from 4.16 and up.
